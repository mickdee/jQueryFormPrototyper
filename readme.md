#Prototype form interactions quickly with this kit of Examples

###What is this toolkit?
This toolkit is **a collection of common form field and input interactions** that you can use to bring some interactive goodness to a static HTML prototype. Think of it as interaction pizzazz that you can sprinkle into a prototype when and where it makes sense to get more detailed feedback from users.

###When should I use this toolkit?
If you have learned all you can from a static prototype, then it might be a good time to think about adding a few targetted interactions that enable you to validate more complex usability concerns with users.

####How do I use this toolkit?
Either copy and paste an example into your prototype and style away (make sure to include jQuery!), or wire up your existing markup if you already have some HTML to start with.
